<p>Protected areas, also known as conservation areas, are designated regions that are managed and protected for their ecological, natural, or cultural values. These areas play a vital role in conserving biodiversity, preserving cultural heritage, and providing essential ecosystem services. As human activities continue to put pressure on our planet's natural resources, it becomes increasingly important to protect these areas to ensure their long-term survival.</p>
